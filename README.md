# Nothing - Fast Windows File Search Tool

A lightweight, fast Windows file search tool written in Rust that reads the NTFS Master File Table (MFT) directly for rapid indexing.

## Features

- **Fast MFT scanning**: Enumerates all files on an NTFS volume in seconds
- **In-memory indexing**: Stores file paths and metadata for instant access
- **Low overhead**: Minimal resource usage during scanning
- **Simple CLI**: Easy-to-use command-line interface

## Requirements

- Windows 10/11
- Administrator privileges (required for raw volume access)
- NTFS filesystem

## Installation

### Build from source

```bash
cargo build --release
```

The compiled binary will be at `target\release\nothing.exe`

## Usage

**Important**: You must run this tool as Administrator.

### Scan and enter interactive search mode

```bash
nothing.exe --interactive
```

Or using the short flag:

```bash
nothing.exe -i
```

### Just scan without searching

```bash
nothing.exe
```

### Scan a specific drive

```bash
nothing.exe D -i
```

### Run as Administrator

Right-click PowerShell and select "Run as Administrator", then:

```bash
cd C:\Apps\Nothing
.\target\release\nothing.exe -i
```

## Interactive Search

Once in interactive mode:
- **Type** to search - fuzzy matching finds files even with typos
- **Results update instantly** as you type
- **Top 50 results** shown, sorted by relevance
- **Total match count** displayed
- **Ctrl+C or Ctrl+D** to exit

### Search Features

- **Fuzzy matching**: Typo-tolerant search (e.g., "dcuments" finds "Documents")
- **Filename priority**: Matches in filenames rank higher than path matches
- **Case-insensitive**: Search works regardless of capitalization
- **Instant results**: Searches entire index in milliseconds

## Example Output

### Scanning

## Current Limitations

**Note**: The current version uses `usn-journal-rs` which provides basic MFT enumeration but does **not** include:
- ❌ File sizes
- ❌ Timestamps (created, modified, accessed)

**What works:**
- ✅ File and directory names
- ✅ Full paths
- ✅ Fast enumeration (155k+ files/sec)
- ✅ Interactive fuzzy search
- ✅ Real-time results

**To get sizes and timestamps**: Switch to the `ntfs` crate for full MFT parsing (3-5x slower but provides complete metadata).

## Roadmap

### Phase 2: Fuzzy Search (Planned)
- Interactive search interface
- Fuzzy matching for file names
- Filter by extension, path, etc.

### Phase 3: USN Journal Monitoring (Planned)
- Real-time file change detection
- Incremental index updates
- Keep index in sync with filesystem

### Phase 4: Enhanced Metadata (Future)
- Switch to `ntfs` crate for full MFT access
- File sizes and timestamps
- Extended attributes

### Phase 5: GUI (Future)
- Native Windows GUI
- Better visualization
- Search result management

## Architecture

```

├── main.rs          # CLI entry point
├── mft_reader.rs    # MFT enumeration logic
├── file_entry.rs    # File metadata structures
├── index.rs         # In-memory file index
└── error.rs         # Error handling
```

## Technical Details

- Uses Windows `FSCTL_ENUM_USN_DATA` to enumerate MFT entries
- Builds full paths by tracking parent directory references
- Stores entries in a Vec with HashMap for path reconstruction
- Progress updates every 100,000 files

## Performance

Expected performance on modern hardware:
- **SSD**: 500k-1M+ files/second
- **HDD**: 100k-500k files/second
- **Memory usage**: ~50-150 bytes per file (varies with path length)

For 1 million files:
- Scan time: 1-10 seconds
- Memory usage: 50-150 MB
